  - Add VT100 filter to make outside sources respect terminal size constraints, also needed to run bash in vsplit mode.

  - Remote script loading

  - add class specific debug
  - better class event and class size handling ?

  - more potent long-click handling including held down ticks.

  - look into discord api / arachnos

  - See about adding ~/ handling for file names.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* LOW PRIORITY

  - Add a file handler.

  - multi-line buffer searches / captures / deletes

  - multi-line triggers (use nested actions?)

  - add color based auto unwrap routine.

  - Start of line anchors aren't working in #replace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ROADMAP

  - dictionary +tabbing

  - editor

  - clickable link support

  - tintin commander

  - sixel graphics

  - windowing

  - blind automapping

  - better attach/detach

  - GUI mode

  - Braille handling

  - Allow converting tt++ scripts to C.

  - session proxies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* STUFF THAT MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED

  - ability to #read entire directories.

  - fix ctrl-r ctrl-d / ctrl-c / enter

  - Option to run #script in background.

  - Make &0 to &99 local.

  - Color compression (already partial support)

  - compact map view mode http://tintin.sourceforge.net/board/viewtopic.php?p=9994

  - https://github.com/eliukblau/pixterm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* BUGS THAT NEED FIXING

  - Word wrap related scroll back problems.

  - Crash on multiple session close

  - \x7B\x7D_____\x7B\x7D_ doesn't match in #regex.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUGS THAT MIGHT NEED FIXING

  - http://tintin.sourceforge.net/board/viewtopic.php?p=7124

  - There's a bug with prompt repetitions with packet patch set.

  - Deal with escaping { } / ; in #script variables.

  - Make tintin char setting by session instead of global.

  - #cr doesn't reset the packet patch state

    + tintin.sourceforge.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* MAPPING

  - add option to show party members on the map

  - add option to add a delay to each exit for #map run

  - map where command that shows relative coordinates.

  - Room creation event

  - Add better table support for data fields.

  - auto adjust max vnum size of mapper.

  - global flag to only show the same area with the mapper.

  - map color setting for hidden exits.

  - Create global exits, (aka portals) like recall, that can be used
    with #map run.

  - Add something to indicate a non standard exit on the ASCII mapper.

* STUFF FOR A RAINY DAY

- Fix up ipv6 support in chat.

  check https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/basic_extended.html

- cursor extension for vim

- interactive script tutorial

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* STUFF I'M NOT SURE ABOUT

- Keep last input visible with repeat enter enabled.

- would be nice to have "#map list" show the variable being filtered on, instead of defaulting to roomname ie, I'm currently writing a script to save "#map list {roomnote} {{\w+}}" into a variable, then map get roomnote for each item in the list and display it...would be nice if when listing for a roomnote, it showed the roomnote

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* STUFF THAT WON'T BE IMPLEMENTED

- Lua or any other scripting language, focus is on developing tintin scripting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ISSUES

- TinTin++ only allows 1 action triggering per line.

- TinTin++ probably should substitute escapes in if checks.

- TinTin++ is not handling #return inside #regex intuitively.
